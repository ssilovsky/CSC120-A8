- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The class represents a player in a video game who is on a basic (x,y) plane and can pick up any item they can think of. There are no set items on the plane, so the user has to make up items to grab and examine. Additionally, all items have a fixed set of random attributes when examined.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added two getters: getLocation() and inventoryItems(). I wanted the user to have an easy way to see what items are in their inventory and their location, but also have the attributes be private. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had to think a bit on how to implement undo(), and I still think I could probably do a better execution. I struggle to think about how to undo a called method. Using an (x,y) plane worked well when trying to figure out how the user would walk in a certain direction. I would suggest for the future student to think about how the mechanics of RPG video games work, and how a player would walk, fly, shrink, etc.
